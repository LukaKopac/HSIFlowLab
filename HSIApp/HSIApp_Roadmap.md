# HSI Desktop Application Roadmap

**Project:** HSI Desktop Analysis Platform

**Author:** Luka Kopač

**Status:** In Development

---

# Vision

Create a desktop application that allows researchers to analyze hyperspectral images without writing code.

The application should provide a complete workflow for loading hyperspectral cubes, inspecting them, preprocessing them, applying masks, running trained machine learning models, visualizing prediction maps, and exporting results.

The application should eventually integrate closely with the existing Python HSI library while providing an intuitive graphical interface suitable for everyday use within the department.

---

# Core Design Principles

## 1. Image First

The image viewer is always the center of the application.

Everything else exists to support image interpretation.

* Metadata
* Spectrum viewer
* Project explorer
* Mask controls
* Prediction controls

should never distract from the image.

---

## 2. Every Phase Produces a Working Program

No unfinished branches.

Every milestone should leave the application usable.

---

## 3. Build Generic Components

Avoid writing features that only solve one problem.

Instead create reusable components such as

* ImageViewer
* SpectrumViewer
* MetadataPanel
* ProjectExplorer
* MaskManager
* PredictionManager

These can then be reused throughout the application.

---

## 4. Separate Logic from UI

Whenever possible

UI

calls

↓

Application logic

↓

calls

↓

HSI library

The GUI should contain as little processing code as possible.

---

## 5. Python Does the Heavy Work

The desktop application is primarily

* visualization
* workflow
* user interaction

Heavy processing should remain in the Python library whenever practical.

# Technical Improvements

Create reusable controls

* SpectrumViewer
* MetadataPanel
* Colorbar
* Histogram
* StatusBar

Separate into projects

```
HSIApp.UI

HSIApp.Core

HSIApp.IO

HSIApp.Visualization

HSIApp.Models

HSIApp.PythonBridge
```

Use MVVM once the project becomes sufficiently large.

---

# Development Rules

## Never build multiple major features simultaneously.

Only one feature branch at a time.

---

## Every commit should leave the application runnable.

---

## Refactor often.

If code feels duplicated more than twice,
stop and improve the design.

---

## Prefer reusable components.

Avoid writing code that only works in one window.

---

## Finish before expanding.

A completed simple feature is more valuable than five unfinished advanced ones.

# HSIApp

A desktop application for loading, visualizing, and processing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data.

The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly interface for working with hyperspectral cubes, including data loading, visualization, metadata inspection, and future integration of analysis and machine learning workflows.

## Features

Currently implemented:

- WPF desktop application using C# and .NET
- Hyperspectral image metadata loading
- ENVI-style header (`.hdr`) parsing
- Basic HSI cube structure
- Initial application architecture for:
  - Data input/output
  - Visualization
  - User interface components

Planned features:

- Loading hyperspectral cubes (`.raw` + `.hdr`)
- Interactive band visualization
- Spectral profile visualization
- Masking capabilities
- Integration with machine learning models
- Connection with Python-based hyperspectral processing workflows

## Development Notes

`HSIPlayground` is a command-line harness for exercising shared HSI and
model-package functionality without starting the WPF application:

```powershell
dotnet run --project HSIPlayground -- inspect-cube <cube.raw>
dotnet run --project HSIPlayground -- inspect-model <model-package-folder>
dotnet run --project HSIPlayground -- validate-model <cube.raw> <model-package-folder>
```
